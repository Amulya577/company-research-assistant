🚀 Overview

This project is built as a part of the Conversational AI Assignment, fulfilling the problem statement:

1. Company Research Assistant (Account Plan Generator)

The agent can:

🔎 Gather information about companies from multiple sources

🧠 Synthesize findings into a clean, structured account plan

⚖️ Provide updates when it encounters conflicting data

✏️ Allow the user to update or regenerate only selected sections

💬🎙 Support chat and voice interaction modes

🌗 Include Dark/Light theme toggle for enhanced UX

🧑‍💼 Adapt to different user personas (Confused, Efficient, Chatty, Edge Case)

✨ Key Features
🔍 Multi-Source Company Research

Pulls data about a company (overview, history, tech stack, culture, challenges, risks).

Synthesizes cross-source information into clean insights.

Works even with partial or ambiguous user input.

⚠️ Conflict Detection & Human-in-the-Loop Updates

The bot notifies the user when sources disagree:

“I’m finding conflicting information about Acme Corp’s revenue. Should I dig deeper?”

This demonstrates agentic reasoning and transparency.

🧩 Structured Account Plan Generator

Automatically generates sections such as:

Company Overview

Strategic Initiatives

Key Challenges

Stakeholders

SWOT

Tech Stack

Opportunities

Risks

Next Steps

✏️ Section-Level Editing

Users may update ANY section individually:

“Update only the Risks section to include budget freeze and increased competition.”

💬 Chat Mode + 🎙 Voice Mode

ChatGPT-style chat interface

Optional voice integration (STT/TTS)

Natural conversational flow

🌗 Theme Switcher (Dark ↔ Light)

Small UI button allows switching between themes with smooth transitions.

🧠 Adaptive Behaviour
